# Purpose

The purpose of this reposityory will be for me to create and practice documenting my learning through the course of CS 260. <br> 
I willl annotate commands, or important information that I will like to have handy, so I don't have to be search for it. I will divide it per console/environment, so it is easier to find what I am looking for.

## IP Address to my new serve and DNS
3.129.226.38

##  SHA
SHA is the unique ID for a specific version, so this can be used with 'git checkout' and this ID.

## Important things I have learned
We use AWS cloud to create our server.
Route 53 is used for creating DNS and attaching it to my IP address of my server. Remember that I need to create records so people can access my server with the DNS. Use * for any subdomain (appended before the root domain), so it can lead to the main server.
